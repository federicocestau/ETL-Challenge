# ETL-Challenge

In this challenge I used two tables, one CSV from koogle.com with the top songs from Spotify 2019 and the other table was created using The Guardian link to scrap into the table and get the information. The following concepts were used:

Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
Once both tables are cleaned up I created my own API using Flask and Visualize the Data into an HTML format. 

It was a great challenge using many libraries and the final result really worth!
